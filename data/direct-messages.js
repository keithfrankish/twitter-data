Life's strange and often deeply unfair, and I'm hugely grateful to friends like you who can meet it with kindness and bemused good humour. So age be damned, congratulations on being you! \n\nCongratulations, too, on your coming escape from wage slavery.

I won't call it retirement, since I'm sure it'll be the start of a new phase of activity of a much more rewarding kind. \n\nI hope we'll see you and your family again soon. I'm sorry we didn't get to see you this summer. It wasn't an easy time. My mother hasn't been well (mastectomy) and we weren't able to travel around as much as we wanted.

But I really do need to do it or kill it -- and I very much want to do the former. My current plan is to write the bulk of it over the summer. If I can get a full draft done by the autumn, I should be able to polish it up by the end of the year. To put some pressure on myself, I'm planning to announce this plan to interested parties (so your message was well timed). The good news is that I'm much better prepared now, so the writing should be relatively easy (he said blithely).

I don't think the GC position has gained any real traction within progressive circles in the United States. Holding that position will get you excommunicated. \n\nMy sense is that the situation is slightly different in the UK. There is a space within progressive circles for the GC position. Hasn't yet reached universities - the overwhelming majority of students will be strongly opposed (hence the deplatforming stuff) - and the mainstream LGBT organisations still seek to exclude GC voices, but there is nevertheless a growing movement (which is strong on social media, organizes meetings, has a presence in the media, etc).\n\nI see people are still determined to read your tweets uncharitably. I am sorry about it all. I just didn't know this would happen. My Twitter following doesn't skew towards any particular activist audience, so normally I can tweet, and it's not really going to be noticed by many people.

I don't know how she did it. It was extraordinary.\n\nYes, the GC people do go in for some fairly juvenile bullying type stuff. It's people in groups, they're no good. But I'd argue that the GC bullying has largely been reactive. It's only in the last year, I'd say, that they've been able to leverage the power of social media to enable them to act as a collective political force. The TRAs have been targeting \"Terfs\" for much longer than that. The Overton window, particularly in the UK, has shifted, though, which is good (from my perspective), but the unfortunate side-effect is the stuff you see with the misgendering, mockery, dogpiling (they really should leave McKinnon along, for example, despite the fact she's a bit of an arse), that kind of thing.\n\nBut yes, it's a war.",

        "text" : "And here’s the illusionism abstract\n\nIllusionism, Then and Now \nBryce Huebner, Georgetown University\nEyal Aviv, George Washington University\nSonam Kachru, University of Virginia\n\nAbstract: Contemporary illusionists, as well as pre-modern Yogācāra philosophers, appeal to magical illusions as a way of clarifying their claims about the constructive nature of typical human cognition. But the import of this appeal to magic diverges in intriguing ways across these traditions. On the one hand, contemporary illusionists argue that qualitative or phenomenal experiences are like magical illusions, which are produced when introspective mechanisms bundle together the outputs of numerous neuro-computational systems, and present them as simple and unified phenomena; this claim does not extend beyond the domain of phenomenal consciousness; and, the account of this illusion is always specified in terms of computational processes. On the other hand, pre-modern Yogācāra philosophers argue that all of the apparently stable and persisting contents of experience are illusory; they do not directly target phenomenal consciousness; and, their account of how such illusions are produced and sustained appeals to the stances we adopt in attempting to make the world that we encounter intelligible, rather than assuming that a specific kind of causal relation can be treated as ultimately real. Our aim in this paper is to explore the implications of adopting a Yogācāra approach to illusionism, as an alternative way of treating mental phenomena as natural phenomena, which are amenable to re-description. Unlike contemporary illusionists, who hold that successful re-description always depends on improved prediction and explanation, we argue that Yogācāra philosophers pursue an approach according to which successful re-description is also normatively constrained by soteriological considerations. And we argue that this form of illusionism discloses the possibility of transformative practices, which have the potential to restructure our experience of the world in normatively significant ways.",

        "text" : "Here’s the abstract for the paper with Genevieve, which we sent in last week for a proposed volume on philosophical approaches to meditation: \n\nControl, Anxiety, and the Progressive Detachment from Self\nGenevieve Hayman and Bryce Huebner\n\nOur aim in this paper will be to explore the phenomenological and biological dimensions of four forms of ‘attachment to self': 1) attachment to a first-person perspective; 2) attachment to the contents of sensory awareness; 3) attachment to an image of the self; and, 4) attachment to a theoretical view of what the self is (Xuánzàng, Chéng Wéishì Lùn § 1.2). We will proceed by examining the relationship between experiences of depersonalization (DPD) and meditative experiences of not-self (anātman); and we will argue that differences in the experience of lacking a self unfold along two distinct dimensions highlighted in the progressive path of letting-go of the four forms of attachment to self: the cultivation of control over entry into the state; and the affective response to entering the state. In the case of DPD, where entry into a state that lacks (2) is unexpected, people tend to experience a flattening of affective states, which is accompanied by the feeling that the possibilities that the world affords are less salient; but critically, feelings of distress and discomfort often persist in this state, in part because of the immediacy of entry into this state, and the disconnect between expected affordances and what is available from the first-person perspective. By contrast, the progressive detachment from self that is pursued in a meditative context starts with the dismantling of a theoretical self (4), and then works through detachment from a self image (3), sensory contents (2), and eventually a first-person perspective (1). This yields a different kind of experience than we see in the context of DPD. The attainment of anātman depends on attention-shaping practices that allow a person to 'let-go' of the sense of control over mind-states and bodily-states while maintaining an awareness that these things are not-self. And where this path is followed, the meditator can navigate the initial experience of anxiety, which is triggered by letting go of self-grasping, in a way that gives way to an experience of positive affect. Crucially, we will argue that the cultivation of bodhicitta is the kind of process that allows for a positive experience of anātman, as it helps to minimize the experience of conflict between what you are doing and what you think you ought to do--which is likely to be one of the primary sources of the fracturing of self that evokes feelings of distress in DPD.",

I'm pretty sure the idea was that we would want to terminate if the result was positive, and the doctor was quite judgemental when we refused the screening. But that was over ten years ago and in Greece, so perhaps attitudes have changed. I hope so. Anyway I'm appalled that I've hurt people and accidentally aligned myself with some very wicked people.

But this was the long question:\n\nAnalytic philosophers often seem to think that there is an answer to questions like “what is it like to be an X”. My strong suspicion is that there is nothing in the world that is stable enough to serve as an answer to that kind of question. They also seem to suppose that there should be answers to question like “what is it like to smell a rotten egg”. My strong suspicion is that there are no viable answers to these kinds of questions either (I would defer to A.S. Barwich on olfaction, but as I read her work smells are pretty clearly illusory in the relevant sense; and I think that similar cases can be developed pretty easily everywhere outside the domain of vision—the difficulties in making a case for vision are interesting, but I don’t want to dwell on them here). So far, I’m willing to follow you down a roughly elliminativist trajectory.  But I don’t think we should try to eliminate all the way through, as you sometimes seem to want to do. \n\nConsider a common Buddhist example: the rope mistakenly perceived as a snake. Once you recognize that it’s a rope, the illusory snake dissipates; the Yogācāra philosophers go further, to suggest that once you recognize that all you are tracking is patterns of contrast, shading, texture, and the like, the rope will dissipate as well. I tend to agree with them, and I tend to think it’s possible to experience all of the persisting and stable phenomena that we encounter as illusory. But if you go this way, there are likely to be many kinds of *experienced* phenomena that you can’t really get rid of. In each sensory domain, and in the domain of thinking, there will be momentary experiences that can be identified in terms of simple and relatively determinate properties (e.g., change in pressure, change in temperature, flows of breath through the body, edges, orientations, blurring, variations in shade, wanting, liking, fearing, etc). I don’t know exactly what is going to be left over when you pull apart the apparently stable and persisting objects (which you need to do if you are going anti-essentialist). But what I’m wondering about is this: why not eliminate the complex qualia that show up in everyday experience, and then look for identities in the domain of momentary experiences that are constantly rising, falling, and changing. \n\nThis is a long comment, and probably still not clear enough as we are coming at things from different perspectives. But hopefully it’s enough to generate a discussion...",

(1) I think that no p properties are instantiated in our world and that p judgements are always false, strictly speaking. But I remain neutral on whether the notion of a p property is coherent. If it is, then you could combine illusionism with property realism and say that p terms refer to real but noninstantiated properties. (2) I also say that p concepts track something real. They (trivially) track whatever properties cause our phenomenal judgements (\"quasi-phenomenal properties\"). I think these are complex clusters of representational and reactive properties -- roughly the multi-dimensional psychological impact perceived features make on us (3) (This is more recent, from in work in progress) I think the folk don't have distinctive p concepts. They have external quality concepts which are concepts of powers in objects to create certain impacts on us -- impacts which are introspectively misrepresented as primitive and which philosophical theory inflates into qualia.

Given this role, it doesn't matter that the book is polemical and corner-cutting -- indeed a more nuanced book wouldn't raise the issues so sharply. So it's great that we have it.

One thing I would have liked to have seen is a story about the capacities that show up in critters without the kinds of cultural feedback she’s talking about. That would have given a better sense of what has to be taken as biological, and it wouldn’t require the attack on genetics (which almost everyone would take to be a red herring). That said, I think she puts a lot of pressure on views that try to posit native capacities without ruling out learning. I think that’s hugely important!

I've just read Peter Carruthers's response to the book, which is dismissive. He thinks that in denying the existence of fully specified cognitive instincts, Heyes is attacking a straw man. In his view, a sensible nativism posits only thinly specified domain-specific *learning* systems -- a view which is compatible with much of the evidence Heyes cites. That may be right, though it also seems to me quite concessive to Heyes's position. I'd be interested to know your reactions to the book -- but only if you have time and inclination of course!

I'm writing a paper on conscious inference, exploring the different  ways we can use Dennettian self-stimulation to break down and work through a complex problem (the different types of self-stimulation itself and the different ways of combining them into extended problem-solving strategies). My question is simply whether you know of any work on this I should read. It's an odd topic in a way -- this kind of thinking is covert behaviour rather than an internal process, and it's more a matter for self-report and anthropology than experiment, though of course reports may be experimentally testable. Maybe there are meta studies of think aloud protocols or something like that? Or perhaps there are anthropological studies of the thinking practices of scientists, mathematicians &amp;c. I'd be very grateful for any pointers (or suggestions as to who to ask for them). Best, K",

I’m still with the FCO and am currently responsible for our corporate operations overseas (bricks and mortar, logistics, moving people and their families around the world).  The MSc is part of my development plan - although also motivated by thoughts about what I may do when I retire (which due to luck of timing will be in only 14 years).  I’m hoping to write a dissertation on how the development and implementation of a national security and foreign policy could be improved with the application of some systemic thought.  I still see quite a lot of the philosophers from my year (we tend to gather once a year or so).  I’m in touch with Alice electronically but haven’t seen her for a few years.  Alexis has recently had some children and is juggling career (she’s involved with some youth development projects) and family.  You may know Michael Garnett (writing on free will at Birkbeck now) and Carrie Jenkins (Vancouver I think) and I see Keith Allen (York) from time to time.  I turn up to Robinson events from time to time (annual reception this year at the House of Commons so I will be there).  I hope we have a chance to catch up at some point and do let me know if you’re passing through London (although I’ve now moved to the countryside with wife and two children I am in Westminster most days).  Best wishes to you, Daniel",

More recently, in 2010, she set off on a mid-life odyssey\nto the southern Peloponnese with her partner Jim and their crazy Jack Russell\ndog, Wallace. What was planned as a year’s adventure turned into four, living\nfirst on a hillside village in the Mani, and later in the Messinian peninsula. The\nadventure inspired her three travel memoirs, starting with Things Can Only Get\nFeta. \n\nShe also writes a blog with a Greek theme https://t.co/BzAyZX7qNv and can\nbe found on FB https://t.co/GQfquXdI81 https://t.co/jytK0ruOGA",

He also likes art and drawing (of football boots)!. I can drop them a line and ask if they are interested connecting with you? It's worth a try.

What triggered the question - the conscious thought - was the ancient art of the memory palace/method of loci. And my long-standing interest in metacognition. Which  I clearly share with you. I'm fascinated by the idea that somehow we can build mental structures to make sense of our own minds. Do I find the site useful? Good question! I certainly like the idea and the layout. And early signs are encouraging. Plus I'm really enjoying the role of gathering questions/finding experts to answer them. Can you recommend anyone else if you're not able to answer yourself?

I was a latecomer to Philosophy, having studied Maths at Oxford some 30+ years ago, specialising in mathematical physics. Sadly, I left academia at 21 and entered management consultancy, which I still practice today.  The reason for my anonymity on Twitter is to maintain a separation between my professional brand and my somewhat unorthodox philosophical views. Panpsychism, for example, may be all the rage today, but this was not the case several years ago when I joined Twitter, and certainly not 25 years ago when I first developed my ideas. Believing that every cell of our bodies has a mind as rich and complex as any human's is not the sort of thing one drops into a conversation with one's potential clients. Such ideas would understandably be considered 'bonkers' by the majority of those I work with - as indeed would I. Perhaps, when I allow my ideas to be published, I will bravely attach my name to them. In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you could keep it confidential.",

Life's a bit complicated at the moment and I'm juggling a lot of things. \nSo how to get started on building a positive illusionist theory -- on solving what I call the *illusion problem*? Here are some suggestions:\n-- Dennett is the place to start, if you've not read him (*Consciousness Explained*, *Sweet Dreams*). He doesn't set out a detailed positive illusionist theory, but he offers lots of hints as to how to build one. \n-- Nicholas Humphrey's *Soul Dust* proposes an ambitious positive illusionist theory. It's an unorthodox but very stimulating book. \n-- My collection *Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness* should be useful, at least for the commentaries, which offer a range of perspectives, including some positive proposals (see in particular, Michael Graziano's paper, which gives a nice summary of his attention schema theory.) \n-- David Chalmers's new paper on what he calls the 'meta-problem' (=the illusion problem) offers a breakdown of possible solutions to the illusion problem. (Unlike me, Chalmers doesn't think that solving this problem will remove the hard problem, but he thinks it needs to be solved anyway (link to paper https://t.co/2SlrRldiIS)\n-- Francois Kammmerer is doing interesting work on the illusion problem -- focusing on why it's so hard to accept that consciousness might be an illusion (what he calls the *illusion meta-problem*). There are some of his papers on his https://t.co/HLdSnq7hr5 page: https://t.co/0CxJhfAA5b\n-- I'm currently preparing a talk on this topic, which I'll be giving next week in Paris. I'll put the slides up on my website afterwards.\n\nI hope that helps a bit. Keep me posted on how you're doing and do ask if I can help more. Email is k.frankish@gmail.com\n\nAll best, Keith",

Materially, people are much better off than when I was a child. But culturally, educationally, it's a wasteland: TV, shopping, entertainment, garden centers, eating, drinking, and clubbing. The environment's not bad -- the mines are gone, the air's cleaner -- but again it's soulless. The fields are huge, treeless, hedgeless, the shops are echoing warehouses, lovingly tended front gardens have become paved parking spots. It's easy to romanticize the past, but I do feel that the culture was richer then, that there were more chances -- chances for education, for meaningful recreation. It's not just the grammar schools (about which I'm ambivalent). There were good libraries, whose staff knew and loved books. There were night schools and adult education classes, taught by people with an evangelical attitude to the arts (the new glass-fronted college in Doncaster focuses on vocational courses). There were endless clubs -- rambling, sports, nature, stamp-collecting. There were church and chapel groups. Perhaps because people were materially impoverished, they valued education and culture. It was a way out, after all. They wanted to get involved, to 'do something with their lives'. There was more earnestness, more hope. Some of this is nostalgia, but not all of it. So yes, I like your idea. Initiatives like that are needed more than ever. Little stitches to tack together our ragged culture. (Which isn't to say you should do it of course; it would be risky, and I'm sure you're doing great work in your current role.) We'll be in the UK next month to visit my mother, who still lives near Doncaster, and I'll tell you my post-Brexit impressions. -- All best wishes, Keith",

I know it's a bit long for Twitter, so please feel no obligation to respond, but I thought I'd try given my confidence that anything you have to say would help.

You say: \n“Whether or not the fascists did something has no bearing, as of itself, on whether that thing is good or bad.”\nI take it your point is that ‘X was done the fascists’ doesn’t entail ‘X is bad’. It all depends on what X is. Bad people do good things and vice versa. (And 99% of what everyone does is morally neutral anyway.) That’s perfectly true. \nBut the fact that X was done by a fascist may *raise the probability* that X is bad. If fascists do significantly more bad things than democrats, then the probability that a randomly chosen fascist act is bad will be higher than the probability that a randomly chosen democrat act is. (Compare: ‘Abe Lincoln said that p’ doesn’t entail that p is true, but it may raise the probability that it is.) You might want to clarify this, to avoid objections.\nBest, Keith",

His most recent book, *From Bacteria to Bach and Back* is very good. You might also like Andy Clark's work on how the mind is situated, embodied, and fundamentally engaged in prediction.

But, if I’m honest, I don’t know if that’s possible, I think that the mind I long for now is simply that of a child’s - for all things to exist again beyond my recognition, before adulthood made some so cocksure as to equate the world to silly and empty ideas. You hinted that you’ve been through similar spells, and you speak as though you’ve succeeded in emerging from them.\nDo you think we can become children again?\n\nBut, of course, it’s all a matter of degree, and you’re right in that I need to break out of this endless chain of self-reflection. \n\nIf I may trouble you for one more thing. The most accurate conception of these psychical processes that I’ve found in literature is works by Lacan - so much so that in discovering him I felt that the vast content of my experiences which I had hoped to eventually put into writing had been exhausted and I now have little else to offer! \nBut, from whatever themes you’ve picked up from our little exchange, do you have any reading that you could suggest for me?",

        "text" : "Regarding what you asked your followers the other day about the Cartesian subject in children, I believe that this is something intrinsic and at the core of our subjectivity and that we eventually define/signify away with age.\nAs a child, my earliest memories are those of overwhelming apprehensions of the subjectivity of experience. Very frequently, I’d be confronted with the brute fact of existence - my existence, existence in general. This was usually followed by nausea and a panic at my certainty that all things are impossible. The progression of this frequent psychical event was very defined and always identical, and for the last few years I’ve been striving to articulate this  childhood experience because somehow and always, I’ve known that this experience was true. I can only describe the journey as a sudden imminence of ‘existence’ as a state - or property - of all things, a vast positivity that must be true. Simultaneously I’d come to be aware of the fact that nothing should be, everything is impossible, that no ‘thing’ exists. Then, follows the realisation that the ‘things’ which I’d believed to exist but apparently cannot is the ‘world.’ I’d be consumed by absurdity and be forced to conclude that this experience was ultimately only mine, and that only I was true, only I existed, and that this world exists only for me. \nOther themes of this experience were the feeling of total dependence, awareness of an ‘other’ which is not itself the world because the world is mine or me. And, a certainty of truth, or that what I was experiencing was truth itself, and that this truth directly opposed all beliefs and concepts I’d formed of the world, and it would shatter those beliefs repeatedly. \nVery distinctly, I remember during these bouts that my eventual retreat would come by means of assuring myself of my thoughts and ideas to rather sublimate this truth at the core of my experience. It was a very distinct and defined  step that I would make, from being in confrontation to the existence at the core of my experience, to rather project ideas such to give myself something else to objectify, and placate my fears like a baby sucking on their thumb\n\nSo, put briefly, that is the first item I thought worth mentioning to you.\n\nWhat I need help with, however, is a problem I have now which I could say is almost the other end of the spectrum to that childhood experience, and, given your studies in philo of mind/consciousness, I thought you might be familiar with what I’m experience.\n\nThe state I am in now is the opposite to that state of my childhood. I feel like I’ve completely lost connection to the ‘real,’ to ‘existence,’ and to my ‘self.’ \nI’ve spent a great deal of time reflecting on this, and I suspect that this in itself has contributed to my problem. While before the real was overwhelming, petrifying and absurd, it atleast also accentuated all aspects of experience, and I can say that there was a profound presence to my objects, everything was very rich and lucid.\nToday, in contrast, everything is hollow and flimsy. I feel like ‘I’ am not here anymore, and neither is the sense of the existence that necessarily lays behind all my perceptions. \n\nI suspect that just as in my childhood that my retreat from the real would come in the form of my own ideas and concepts, I believe that growing up has proliferated these ideas such that I can’t find my way out of them at all. My own thoughts have blocked the path to the real. \nAs I become more detached from the real, I feel too that my subjectivity itself is withering, phenomena itself is like a dim lightbulb. I don’t even understand what philosophy is about anymore, whereas before I understood always that everything related back to this central experience of my childhood.",

As someone who thinks it's essential to take an evolutionary approach to the mind, I hate the way some people use evolutionary ideas to promote reactionary agendas. It doesn't have to be that way, and I think that evolutionary psychologists have a duty to make that clear. Of course no science done by humans is without bias, and of course some evolutionary psychologists have had nasty agendas. But ep can equally be done with progressive aims -- or just with a sincere attempt at objectivity. Some of the things Petersen said in the interview are fairly uncontroversial I think (though I'm no expert), but he seemed to be pitching them with an intent that I didn't like at all. And his rant at the beginning about about men needing to grow up was creepy. He came across as a soi-disant alpha male preaching to gamma males. I'm not surprised to hear he doesn't have a good sense of humour. Sorry again for putting you on the spot (Carl G is lovely chap, by the way.) I hope all's well with you. Love from Maria and me.",

What that account doesn't make explicit is that Peterson (1) gained fame by very publicly denying trans students the right to choose their own pronouns and by denying the reality/legitimacy of some (most?) trans gender identities, (2) claims to champion free expression but has also advocated in various ways for the end of such disciplines as gender studies, queer studies, etc. (any programs associated with social justice), (3) is a master at RTing his opponents in such a way that his army of followers obediently begins to harass those opponents (one quite innocuous tweet of mine got well over a hundred angry, abusive replies), (4) has shared the Facebook pages of student protestors (against him) on Twitter, thereby informing his followers of their (the protestors') names and uni affiliations, leading to extensive harassment and abuse of those students, (5) recently released a video in which he claimed that women can't be genuine peers to men because men aren't permitted to punch women (and for reasons that combine evo psych with Jung, men must be able to punch a person in order to be on a level plane with them). I am one of the few academics in Canada who is willing to talk to the media about Peterson. When I do, I receive abuse. I'm willing to talk about him in public (because somebody has to and that's what tenure is for), but I try not to unnecessarily invite attention from his followers on Twitter. Incidentally, a bunch of Peterson fans have recently started following me on Twitter. That's why I've been doing #dailyacademicfreedom. I'm curating my feed for them in the hopes a couple of them will learn something. :)",

I've no desire to defend or excuse what did. (And I should stress too that I haven't seen him for years -- the period I referred to was back in the mid-1990s.) But I don't want to write off people who've done bad things, especially when I believe they have good in them too. I hate that 'rot in hell, throw away the key' attitude you find  in tabloid comments sections. Maybe it stems from my own anxiety. I don't *want* to think of the world as full of monsters and exploiters. The image depresses me hugely. I want to believe that we all share a common humanity and that even wickedest can be redeemed. Very naive, I'm sure, but it gives me hope and strength.",

I've read much of your work on illusionism.\n\nI primarily work in social science, though I have a little philosophical experience: namely, an R&amp;R at Utilitas on moral circles. But I've taken a stab at a manuscript in the field of consciousness, arguing for an eliminativist/illusionist view based in what I call an \"imprecision argument\": namely, that definitions of phenomenal consciousness, qualia, etc. are not precise in the way implied by 'realist' views. I think there's an inconsistency here, or at least a tension, which gives us good reason to say phenomenal consciousness doesn't exist as currently conceived.\n\nWould you be interested in reading over an early draft of that manuscript? The target journal I have in mind is the Journal of Consciousness Studies. I've had a couple philosophy colleagues read it, but none with as much experience in this literature as you.\n\nThanks for your consideration,\n\nJacy",

I've also small sketches of Iraklion, a village in Mani, and the Fort of Palamedes in Navplion,   I could do a representative sample with a narrative and a dozen or so.

They also Extremely simplify issues of sex determination and gender identity determination in a way that makes it seem that only individuals who were born with XX chromosomes and child-bearing reproductive system even can possibly be women.

As I said, the consensus is that such instances of individuals using the self-ID state mechanisms specifically to do harm to women are few if any, and it's difficult to even really see what such instances would look like. Even if we posit that there will be some individual women who end up harmed in part because of the self-ID law (and by women here I mean cis women, women who are not trans, and by in part I mean as in the self-ID law is a condition to the harm), that amount and the harm they experience will be outweighed by the giving trans people a mechanism to receive state recognition as being who they are, which as you probably know from various other \"debates\" through history, is a very important thing for that group",

Yes, memneon is a kind and nice person, after a while though, we started disagreeing on almost-everything related to philosophy of mind, consciousness, etc.,... yes, MV is motivated by many other reasons than to ‘explain’ FT, and the MV arises internally, from the structure of the ‘Euler-Lagrange-Hamiltonian’ phase/state-space equations. As to whether the MV explains FT, I think so and I’d have to convince Philip of the reasons. Now here’s my question: since recording and taping are now issues that are on the table, it behooves all involved to be as prepared as circumstances allow. My experience from a few years back on Facebook groups live discussion that were recorded pertaining to the String Wars is unpleasant to say the least: my side, mostly involving the mathematical reasons why string/M-theory is the leading candidate, was used by non-mathematicians/non-physicists to bad ‘social relations’ purposes. Can I then propose that we do this after the kids finish the school year, somewhere hence starting June+?",

To reach the headquarters of the uni on Panepistimioupolis street take the metro (blue line) towards syntagma (one stop from Evangelismos) change to red line at Syntagma (one stop-Panepistimio), The central building of the athens trilogy is the uni senate house. The talk is in there but you  might have to go in from the left hand side gate. (If you wanted to walk from the hotel, the walk via Kolonaki and solonos is atmpst 30 minutes)\nWe could meet around 6pm on Korai street just across the Uni (a little pedestrianised street), grab a coffee and then go to your talk together.

The general theme will be consciousness, so perhaps we could talk about your work on perceptual illusions? (We can discuss the content more nearer the time.) I won't say anything about you on Twitter unless you specifically want me to -- as you say, it's quite normal to take a break. Belated birthday wishes for last Saturday. I hope you had a great day.

The difficulties in explaining consciousness are due to dichotomies originated from anthropocentric bias and \"lexical apartheid\". Philosophy of consciousness is exploding with abundance of vague \"descriptions\" without \"definition\". While \"undefined is undescribed\". The first problem of consciousness is the problem of its definition which in turn is based on identification of exact cause of knowledge.\nBy the current paradigm, dualism is hard to verify and monism is hard to imagine and explain. The proposed new paradigm termed as, \"Concept Science\" provides the creative solution.  It establishes relationship between dichotomous concepts e.g. mind and body etc.\nThe paradigm of Concept Science is based on assumptions that: 1) Language is brain (physical system) operating physical mechanism, 2) The so-called natural languages, in fact, are artificial public languages invented out of private languages of qualia based on the thumb rule that all men experience similarly of similar stimuli. 3) The causes of meanings are physical experiences, 4) each word of a natural language is a label/signifier of an experience, socio-psychologically conditioned during education of language starting from “ma-ma” or “A for Apple” and 5) no dictionary is scientifically verified for the meaning of words. Thus meanings given in dictionaries are not true representative of physicality of experiences or of their expressions. \nEverything is of matter for the matter and by the matter.

Research on Ishihara colour vision test shows that scores (on plates of “dots”) below 12 indicate colour vision deficiency. The sizes of dots represent quantities of photons.  \n \nTherefore primitive quality of colour is real and is a meta-quality of physical properties (qualities) of photon. Primitive quality is neither an illusory nor a dummy property.",

But I find it one of those überemotive issues that starve logic and understanding. All your qualifications on Twitter (if I like a tweet it does not mean that I necessarily advocate that position etc) are testament to this. And like you, I live for qualifications and clarifications. But sadly this debate too often collapses before any meaningful progress is made.

So I don’t know if you’ll see this but I just the other day read about Illusionism in an article in The Science Focus and I’m quite intrigued by it as a theory of consciousness- it was relieving out of many of the theories to at least see something that completely disregarded or didn’t have any potential to rely on the intangible- the phenomenal, which is something with lacking explanatory power that cannot be measured. I’m a philosophy student at A-Level and we’ve recently covered a large portion of metaphysics of mind, and I don’t know how much you’d agree but your disregard of the phenomenal seems to share similarities with the Eliminative Materialism perspective of eliminating redundant “mental”/“phenomenal” concepts that no longer fit the scientific framework. I just wondered, by proposing that the phenomenal is an illusion, are you only attempting to disregard phenomenal theories of consciousness for the sake of development in the field, or do you propose a way yourself by which our physical consciousness works?",

I'm increasingly dissatisfied with the way academia works and keen to explore new ways of promoting public understanding and discussion of philosophy. (That's one reason I use Twitter.) I'm also very keen on the theatre and have a (so far largely unrealized) ambition to write for it. So, yes -- anytime! \n\nI haven't seen The Hard Problem, though the impression I got from the reviews wasn't positive. It sounded as if Stoppard didn't understand the philosophy and was making some rather clunky connections with character. But, as I say, I haven't seen it. \n\nI agree completely about The Matrix. It ignores everything we know about cognitive embodiment and trades on people's latent dualistic intuitions. Fine as an action movie, I suppose, but worse than useless as a stimulus to philosophical discussion.\n\nI do hope your son gets to do some classes with DD. I've got to know him well in recent years, and we are currently collaborating on a project exploring the foundations of consciousness and autonomy. (Actually, that's something that could be mentioned on my WP page.) I have huge admiration for him, and I get pretty annoyed with critics who don't even try to understand what he's saying.",

But then (as he also allows) the debunking argument kicks in. If we can explain our reports &amp; judgements about Xs without mentioning Xs, then that's a strong reason to distrust the reports &amp; judgements and regard Xs as illusory. Hence the realist must posit some *additional* source of access to Xs, separate from the process that generates our reports &amp; judgements about them -- a sixth sense in the case of UFOs, direct acquaintance in the case of qualia.

What is really problematic, I think, is the idea of direct *non-representational* awareness of phenomenality (acquaintance). I can make little sense of that within a naturalistic framework.

Of course in a sense I *am* denying that we feel pain. If pain = a subjective intrinsic feel, then I''m denying it. But I don't just leave a gap there -- I assume there will be a rich functional story to tell about what's going on when we are (as we say) in pain. And I'd argue that this story is in the end *more* satisfying than the phenomenal one (which has a hard time making pain causally effective and psychologically real). If people are prepared to get past their initial incredulity, they tend to find the story at least worth considering. Maybe you can read the papers I'll send you (and perhaps some of Dennett's work) and then we can talk about what makes sense to you and what doesn't?",

But I have also noticed that when I am in a subconscious state without going into a “conscious” state that the different scenarios I have been in is that all the time perceptions feel they have “flown” by at the same time. So if being in a subconscious state the time flows by at the same perception rate for me maybe it’s the same for everyone, and the difference we assume is happening because of not always being in a subconscious state but the differences of going in and out of these two states. I have never been truly in a fully conscious state for an extended period as one may call a turiya nor a car accident to feel a fully perception rate which if subconscious rate is the same for me as for everyone then a fully extended conscious state might be the same. The difference in perceptions again is perceived differently because of different timings in being between these two states. Just as for children time perception flows so much more slower and that has to do with being more conscious more of the time even  though their subconscious perception rate is the same and the conscious perception rate is the same but just the fact of being more conscious more of the time we just believe we all have different times. And this brings that it might not have the only clear cut connection to experiences. But it may in that the processing of it is quicker if relating to a past experience/sense and thus quicker to get out of that so called conscious state which is brought on by the processing of that old experience which note is already a past experience due to the processing of it (it has already happened). Also note say for visual illusions ones that are more illusional are taking longer to process and thus more capable of being more illusional. And if this processing is the result of the phenomenal because of them being somewhat misrepresented due to being of the so called past, the blue one sees is due to this processing and that is distinguished between the red that person saw, one sees because both frequencies and or objects but have different processing times. And if everyones timings of being in a full conscious state is the same and everyones real time is the same in a full subconscious state than we are all built the same way and safe to say my blue is your blue since we are built the same, just our perception of time is different due to being in the two different states for different periods of time (note the conscious is just new processing experiences). Our processing times maybe different due to experiences but should be irrelevant to the frequency aspect of light colours as they are processed at just different times by our bodies(eyes) just due to their frequencies.\n\nConsciouses is brought about due to processing the information yet it is the past and the longer the processing the more of an illusion. Could dreams take longer to process and thus why so mystical/ illusional? Visual illusions more illusional since taking longer to process?",

(That's a selfish wish -- I'm sure I could have learned from you and made interesting connections between my work and yours.) Watching it through, I could see that you were wanting to come in at various points but at the time I didn't realize and kept on talking. (Here's where visual feedback would have been helpful.) So, yes, it would be nice to have another chart with you both sometime -- a genuine discussion, not just me lecturing! By the way, you might be interested in this paper of mine on delusions, which builds on the commitment-based view of conscious belief that I sketched: https://t.co/SgPzi2idnM \n\nThanks again for inviting me and very best wishes.

With respect to mental health, maybe we could focus on how our minds are prone to shaping internal realities, being unable to capture life as it is.

I'm a professional visual designer with a lot of experience in editorial design (and an amateur Dennettian philosopher) and I'd recommend going with a designed layout for readability. There are many typographic parameters we adjust for a better reading experience, like typeface choice, point size, leading, line length, etc. and the manuscript format isn't a good choice regarding many of these parameters. I'd love to help if you need it. We normally work in Adobe Indesign for multipage documents (which has lots of advantages and shortcuts for typesetting); I can set the articles there and give you the PDFs, or I can create a template for you to use. Or, I can at least give some general feedback on typography for whatever software you're using. Cheers!",

An airbnb should be fine if you just want a place to sleep. I strongly recommend hiring a car -- it's a big island and there's lots to see. We're in the north, in Heraklion, but we could all meet up somewhere. Keep us posted on your plans and let us know if you any more questions. We'll look forward to seeing you! K",

If do want a hard copy, look on ebay and Amazon marketplace -- there are fairly cheap copies (£20-odd) available. \n\nThanks for your kind words. It sounds as if we're of the same academic generation -- the same reference points. I don't think those debates have been properly settled, and I want to do a new version of M&amp;S re-presenting the core ides for an audience two decades on. The book got a somewhat negative (and, I felt, quite unfair) review by Dominic Murphy on NDPR, which did it harm I think. \n\nI'm glad your initial impression of was positive, and I'd love to hear your more detailed thoughts if it interests you and you have the time. *But please do not feel any obligation!* \n\nVery best, Keith",

        "text" : "My name is Ricardo Lopes, and I am from Portugal. I started my YouTube channel, The Dissenter, last February, in which I’m trying to bring people interviews and talks with intellectuals and academics from a variety of areas and disciplines, ranging from the Arts and Philosophy to the Social Sciences and Biology.\nThe primary motivation to start this channel had to do with the fact that I hold a diversity of intellectual interests, which I’ve been cultivating throughout the years. And so, I decided to start by trying to invite some of the academics I admire the most to have intellectually stimulating and relevant conversations with them, and then to share them with you.\nA secondary motivation was to try to gather a myriad of academics that have been doing work in fields which could have something to offer to a better understanding of our human condition, thus providing us with knowledge with practical value. \nI’ve been interviewing major academics and scholars from fields like Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, Primatology and Biology, and Philosophy. \n- From Psychology: David C. Geary, Richard Lippa, Leda Cosmides, Diana Fleischman, Eric Turkheimer, Lewis Goldberg, Richard Nisbett, Randy Thornhill, David Buss, Gad Saad, Lee Jussim, Hal Arkes, Lee Ross.\n- From Anthropology: David F. Lancy, Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, Robert Boyd, Richard Shweder, Alan Fiske, Terrence Deacon.\n- From Philosophy: Patrick Lee Miller, Stephen Hicks, Simon Blackburn, Patricia Churchland, Massimo Pigliucci, Rebecca Goldstein, Peter Carruthers, Colin McGinn, Michael Ruse, Alexander Rosenberg.\n- From Primatology: Frans de Waal.\n- From Neuroscience: Dale Purves.\n- Others: Azar Gat, Robin Hanson, James Flynn, Johan Norberg, Jon Entine, Michael Shermer, people from Gapminder like Fernanda Drumond, Richard Wilkinson.\n- Upcoming interviews: Michael Graziano, Mark Blyth, David Papineau, Don Ross, second interview with Randy Thornhill, Peter Richerson, Noam Chomsky.\n- And in contact with people like Peter Singer, Paul Bloom, William von Hippel, Robert Plomin, Gregory Cochran, Richard Haier, Edvard Moser, E. O. Wilson. \n\nIf you find that my work might be of interest to you, I now ask you to go and\nCheck out my channel\nhttps://t.co/Gt1h16T9Om\nAlso, follow me on\nTwitter:\nhttps://t.co/EIuUSPwLVj\nFacebook:\nhttps://t.co/cpgIRk27I2\nhttps://t.co/lRJHRF4u2i\nAnd consider supporting me on Patreon, for as little as 1$:\nhttps://t.co/89EladymNl",

I am Mr. Hammad Rahman a staff of Barclays bank Dubai, United Arab Emirate and Head of Administration and Government Relations at Barclays Bank PLC UAE .I write you this proposal in good faith hoping that I will rely on you .In 2006, one Mr.Daniel Frankish , who has same surname as yours and who has your country in his file as his place of origin, made a fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, valued at $18,400,000.00 with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of Manager Director now. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 16th of January 2009. Unfortunately, while on a business trip ,he died in a deadly earthquake that occurred on May 12, 2008 in Sichuan province of China which killed at least 68,000 people. Since the last quarter of 2009 until today,the management of Barclay's bank have been finding a means to reach him so as ascertain if he will want to roll over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdraw .Since September 2009,when I discovered that this will happen , I learn of his death ,so I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceed for charity .                                                                                      \nSome directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr Daniel is now late, they will corner the funds for themselves. Therefore, I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death since you have the same name, so that my bank head quarters will pay the funds to you. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and you only have to put in your details into the information network in the bank computers and reflect you as his next of kin. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds equal, 50/50% to both parties My share will assist me to start a charity organization to help the poor and also own a company which has been my dream. Let me know your mind on this and please do treat this information as TOP SECRET. We shall go over the details once I receive your urgent response strictly through my personal email address , HammadRahman1954@gmail.com  . Have a nice day.\n\nBest regards, \n\nMR.Hammad Rahman\nHammadRahman1954@gmail.com",

Our aim is to be able to finance the environment more efficiently and on the basis of our proposals.\n\nWe would launch a collection to mitigate the damage as soon as possible to begin rehabilitation\n\nA good-natured animal loving animal cannot go without words.\n\nWe look forward to working together to provide you with effective assistance.\n\nWith the deepest sympathy, we await your kind reply\n\nDonat:\n\nBank: \n\nHU25 10300002 13151197 00011902\n\nhttps://t.co/USMJKf5QUw\n\nBudget\n\n1: Our proposal here is to restructure the financing of environmental aids in such a way that only the technical expenditure of the budget is incurred.\n\n(this proposal is based on a long-standing economic activity), thus funding will become self-financing in the long term, meaning that no technical costs will be incurred from the seventh year onwards. Of course, if they want to increase their environmental funding in the seventh year, they can start a new funding by doubling the amount of the grant.\n\n2. In the field of environment, start the replacement of obsolete vehicles, the most polluting sources of our environment and health, on the basis of the budget proposal. Even on a social basis. Continue to support real estate energy investments with the widest possible access to renewable energy equipment for business companies and individuals.\n\n3. The economic territory. To do this, do not recommend it as described in the first and second automatically bring economic recovery in respect of the automotive industry, construction, and insurance, equipment for renewable energy manufacturers, vendors ..\n\nBy creating new jobs also reinforce the internal piacot.Tehát to get a clearer picture please provide me with the above link, which explains what we base our activities on.\n\nhttps://t.co/KkHIMKOYMi\n\nWe would like to successfully close this initiative because it will improve the lives of all in the long run. We need help to be effective. First and foremost, to make EU citizens aware of this initiative. We are also looking for the most interested as car dealers, manufacturers and suppliers in this field. We would like the representatives of the area to support our work together. We believe that this partnership can be established in the shortest time possible if a partner like you is here to help. All support, including promotion of the initiative, sponsor car, fuel card, and financial support, is welcome.\n\nIn the hope of a successful long-term cooperation, I look forward to your kind response.\n\nhttps://t.co/9pwOqAcyy2\n\nBest regards\n\nZsolt Jaczina\n\nChairman of the Civil Committee https://t.co/kcsOcXZhQl",

My bank management is yet to know about his death, i knew  because he was my friend and i am his account officer. Freddie did not mentioned any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, so few months ago i was going through his account details and i noticed the contract  needs to be renew or terminate, so i thought of it  and i decided to get a next of Kin for the  fund to be release from Emirate NBD, now i am seeking for your co-operation so we can get the fund to our self instead of allowing it to remain in the bank custody if the bank do not hear from Late Freddie, they will use the fund for their personal use, i have prayed and made a very good home groundwork concerning this transaction before contacting you, since you share the same last name with late Freddie. My bank head-quarter will release the fund to you as the rightful next of Kin , there is no risk involve in this transaction. The transaction is 100% risk free and secured once you adhere to the transaction guildlines and instructions while you keep it secret between us .\n\nI am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the fund equal, 50%:50% for both parties, my share will assist me to set-up my own company which has been my dream. Let me know your mind on this and please make this information a TOP SECRET. \nWe shall go over the details once I receive your urgent response strictly through my personal E-mail address....\nsuvosarkar0417@gmail.com\n                               &amp;\nEmiratenbdmanagment19@outlook.com\n\nRegards,\nSuvo Sarkar.\nSenior Executive Vice President, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management at Emirates NBD.",

        "text" : "Hi Julia -- Thanks for your message. The Truth Demon is a way of dramatizing a view I've been advocating for some time. It came out of thinking about the difference between conscious and nonconscious belief, which I set out in my book /Mind and Supermind/ (CUP 2004). Very briefly, I argue that conscious belief is form of acceptance, where acceptance is a commitment to treating a proposition as true for the purposes of reasoning and decision making. (See Jonathan Cohen's lovely little book /An Essay on Belief and Acceptance/ OUP 1992). Now, we can accept propositions without believing them. For professional purposes, a lawyer may accept that her client is innocent without really believing that he is (Cohen's example -- he gives many others). So the question for me is how to delimit the set of acceptances that are genuine (conscious) beliefs. An obvious suggestion is that it is motivation: conscious beliefs are acceptances that are epistemically motivated. But for various reasons I argue that this won't do and that the crucial factor is the deliberative context (see ch.5 of M&amp;S). Conscious beliefs are acceptances that we are willing to rely on in contexts where we have an overriding desire to take only truths as premises (contexts that are /truth-critical wrt to premises/ or TCP for short). I offer various examples in the book, but I've recently started using the Truth Demon as a convenient shorthand. When you're being questioned by the TD you're in a TCP context. (Note that TCP contexts needn't be ones of disinterested inquiry, where epistemic concerns are paramount. When being questioned  by the TD you have overwhelming *practical* reasons for taking only truths as premsies.) I've suggested that for believers the notion of God acts as a Truth Demon, at least in private reflection, and there's fascinating evidence that the medieval priesthood made practical use of this fact: see e.g. https://t.co/Pw4OiQm1BC\n\nI'm not sure that that answers your question, but I hope it's of some use! Do let me know if I can help in an other way. Congratulations on your new book. It sounds fascinating and timely, and I'll look forward to reading it! \n\nAll the best, Keith",

        "text" : "I had a strange experience a while ago. I had done a lot of drugs (just stum, cathonines, not intrinsically hallucinogenic but they kept be up and the sleep deprivation messes the brain up), way too much, and I tried to sleep after being awake for 3 or 4 days but I couldn't. I would constantly pass in to conscious sleep paralysis instead and feel really weird and strange, disembodied, bit scary hallucinations, strange feelings, classic stuff, etc. And that kept going on until exhaustion made me sleep. But I woke up again with sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming, but in several consciousnesses that thought I was awake and experiencing different memories and events, imagined and real at the same time.\n\nHard to describe, but I was living around 7 lives, both imagined and genuine memories at the same time in completely convincing fashion, as in, I did not realise I was lucid dreaming except in the one simultaneous experience of me lucid dreaming that I had whilst I had the other experiences of memories and fantasy.\n\nAnd I could not escape, as is normal with sleep paralysis, although ''I could'' but only within the experience itself. My eyes were open so I could see the window, and the sun, and the sky, and my blankets half over my eyes, dreamlike, light, as well as looking out of the eyes or unto the world of all the other lives I was living. It went on forever. The most impressive bit about it was that every single one of them was 100% convincing, I could not tell which one was the real one and which was hallucination and I did not try, they were all valid, all happening, all genuine, all on par with the experience of knowing that they were lucid dreams during sleep paralysis.\n\nOnce I came out of it, I was pretty weirded out, hard to make anything out of that kinda thing, which genuinely you don't have the capacity to process. But the worst thing was that it didn't go away, that night I still could not sleep and my fantasies would still creep in to the real world as solid as matter, sound, taste, and visuals as the real world, making NO sense, and KNOWING they were fake as well as experiencing them as being real, and they were real, I felt, heard, saw, etc. etc. etc.  them as anything else.\n\nI was scared cuz I thought I had done myself a brain damage that I would forever have this, but I guess the brain chemistry reset and I've not had it again (despite ignoring the obvious lesson to be drawn from this).\n\nI just thought this is somehow relevant to illusionism, obviously you know this is possible but it's something else experiencing these kinds of things.\n\nI've always been sceptical of reality in a weirdly risk-taking way (general this isn't real so it can't hurt me) but it's gotten worse after this where I now think more often things are maybe not real when they probably are, but in a way where I simply find the distinction less and less relevant if that makes sense.\n\nAnyway thought you'd find that interesting! I find illusionism convincing in principle like you say, but panpsychism the more romantic or even preferable idea.\n\nI still remember messaging you about some or other thought I had (I think weirdly while having sex with this one girl I was seeing at the time) about the nature of consciousness, and you saying that ''this exists, it's panpsychism''. HAHA I was so chuffed that I came up with a philosophical idea not independently obviously but at least as a product of the coalescence of own growth.",

        "text" : "THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS LAWFULLY CONNECTED WITH OUR SPACE- AND TIMEOBSERVATIONS\n\nA theory by Maarten Vergucht\n\nI want to post 'my theory about the universe here. Because it is a philosophical theory about the physical nature of the universe, related to our conscious mind. I think that consious minds are crucial to measure time and space. Let me explain this. There is a little bit physics involved, but there is always google to look it up. I post it here, because physistists do not accept 'the conscious mind' as being part of physics. My theory is philosophy and physics. It includes 'the mind' as a 'virtual constant' in reality.  It's about our observations of time and space. Einstein said: time is an illusion. Therefore, space must be an illusion too.\nAsk a foton, an absolute object in this universe, massless, dimensionless (at that speed) and with absolute values for speed for every observer. (I do not use the word: reference frame, or coördinate system). So a foton can tell us something about the absolute values of the universe in itself, without observers: zero time and zero space. (if you use a foton as the ultimate referenceframe). Second: only a conscious mind can experience time. Not a detector. I do not believe that space and time came into existence by a Big Bang (Big Bantheory). Time and space come into existence as a result of an interaction of a consious mind with spacetime. Spacetime is a mathematical object, very real: it's the Universe in itself. More real, then our relative observations of time and space. But pure mathematical and not observable. Only deducable. What's the difference between a conscious mind and a detector or measuring device? A conscious mind can experience time, a detector cannot. The scientist who starts a scientific experiment in the laboratory, he is doing the experiment and looking at the results. He experiences 'an unfolding of the phenomena outthere, moment by moment. But the phenomena 'outthere' do not exist in that form. These phenomena exist as events in spacetime together. So, even a scientific experiment, through time, is actually an illusion of a consicous mind. There are three main constant, according to me: a conscious mind, the properties of light, and spacetime (mathematical object). The interaction between these three non-dimensional things results in the experience and measurements of space and time. So, a consious mind is crucial to be able to measure time and space and to observe experiments 'unfolding moment by moment in time', while these experiments exist outthere together in spacetime. If you like this theory, share it with as many people as possible. Scientists do not want to hear about 'consciousness' or 'the mind'. It's an illusion of the brain, is the current idea. Consciousness, however, is in my opinion, a 'virtual constant', a keyfactor, in our observable universe.\n\nThank you.\n\nMaarten Vergucht",
